# sc-banner-template
A simple free soundcloud banner template with guides, clearance shapes, font alignment etc.

![Template](https://github.com/patchstep/sc-banner-template/releases/download/1.0/sc-banner-template@2x.png)

## Features

- Coloured shapes to indicate where each element lives
- Guides for alignment
- Text with indentation (as close as I could get to perfect)
  - The SoundCloud font is [Interstate](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/interstate)
- Legend to identify which shape is used for what
- 2 overlapping artboards (in the illustrator project), to make it easier to export both at the same time.

Since Illustrator is a vector graphics program, you can export at lots of different scales, without committing to the relatively small artboard size.

Use `[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Y]` to see your banner in the "Pixel View".
